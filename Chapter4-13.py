4-13. Buffet: A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods. Think of 
five simple foods, and store them in a tuple.
•	 Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers.
•	 Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the 
change.
•	 The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different 
foods. Add a block of code that rewrites the tuple, and then use a for
loop to print each of the items on the revised menu
