5-3. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print
a message that the player just earned 5 points.
• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that
fails. (The version that fails will have no output.
